1. Top Customers Matter Most
The analysis shows that only a few customers bring most of the total sales in each country.
This means the business depends a lot on its top customers, so keeping them happy is very
important.

2. Sales Are Different by Country
Customer ranking by country shows that some countries perform much better than others.
Sales are not equally distributed across all regions.

3. Monthly Sales Change Over Time
Month-over-Month analysis shows that sales go up in some months and go down in other months.
This shows seasonal behavior and helps in better planning for sales and inventory.
